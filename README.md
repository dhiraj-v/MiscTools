The goal of this repository is to create tools/utilities that would help user maintain system health better. 

TimelyBattery.py
This is used to notify the user with current battery level(%) and current time every 10 minutes. 
prerequisite: python3 installed. 
If using ubuntu 20:
  open "startup application preferences"
  add command "python3 'pathToFile'/TimelyBattery.py"
This will run the program on start up and will keep running in the background.
